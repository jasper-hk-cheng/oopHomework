=

1. open the directory the file "runOopDatebase.bat" laid **with MS windows file system**.

1. double click the "runOopDatebase.bat" file and the command line prompt will pop up on the screen.

1. now the database has already been started up and the newly code (homework 06) can be tested directly by run the "JsonConfigReadingTester.java".

1. if you want to shutdown the database, focus on the command line window and key press "ctrl + c" and reply the "are you sure to shutdown ??" prompt with "Y" without considering alphabet case (case insensitive).

1. by the way, if you need an UI to execute sql script for the database directly, you can double click neither the file "runManager.bat" or "runMangerSwing.bat" after the database started up successfully.
